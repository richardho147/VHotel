                    <h3>EXTRAORDINARY OWNER</h3>
                    <p>
                        The story of VhoTel is inseparable from the visionary owner, 
                        Rones Magdel Khim, whose passion and determination brought 
                        the hotel to life. Born into a family with a deep appreciation 
                        for hospitality, Rones grew up surrounded by tales of legendary 
                        hotels and extraordinary guest experiences. From an early age, Rones was 
                        captivated by the world of luxury hotels. His parents, who owned a boutique hotel, 
                        instilled in him a strong work ethic and an understanding of the intricate 
                        details that make a guest's stay truly exceptional. Inspired by their teachings, 
                        Rones set out to create a hotel that would redefine luxury and become a beacon of 
                        excellence in Jakarta.
